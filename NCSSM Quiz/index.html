      <h3>How does the quiz work?</h3>
      <p>This quiz will ask the user 15 questions and based on their answers to each question, the quiz will display a hall or halls that we find to be suitable to the user. User should be honest as they take the quiz to provide the most accurate result possible.</p>

          <h4>Jake Rose</h4>
          <p>Jake has experience coding in multiple languages including Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  He has used Python for multiple projects and classes including Foundations of Data Science at NCSSM.  He has used the other three languages for this class.</p>
          <p>For this project, Jake worked primarily on the javascript for this webpage.  He figured out how to condense many parts of the javascript, including initilizing every button and input for the quiz page.  To do this, he used loops to iterate through each question and answer to assign each "<code>document.getElementById</code>" to an element in an array.</p>
